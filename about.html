        When I'm not helping teams be productive while maintaing a healthy work-life balance, I'm doing the following things.

        <h2>Playing Music</h2>

    <p>
        I have played music for many years now. Starting with the drums and then moving on to learn guitar
        and bass guitar. I teach beginner music every week in the Contra Costa County and Marin County area. Even though it can be demanding
        at times, It is something I am very grateful to do, and it is very fulfilling for me in my life.

        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <img class="img-about2" src="./photos/baseball.jpeg"/>
        <p>I enjoy watching sports, especially from bay area teams, such as; 49ers football, Warriors basketball
            and SF Giants baseball. As a kid and teenager I used to play baseball almost everyday, and I still play
            baseball atleast once or twice a month with friends. Though I am not that good at soccer, I watch soccer alot as well
            I enjoy watching international soccer as well as playing FIFA on a regular basis.

        <h2>Plumbing</h2>
        <img class="img-about" src="./photos/plumbing-equipment-house-plans-10003275.jpg">
        <p> I enjoy knowing how to do plumbing. My dad is a plumbing contractor and my brother is a union plumber,
            so needless to say it rubbed off on me as well. I feel there is an artistry in connecting pipes and making
            water run through water supplylines, as well as a feeling of accomplishment when fixing a leak or stoppages
            in a home.  </p>
